### xenharmonic tuning utility

## Initial

We're going to set up the auxillary services on Google Cloud, such as Storage and a Cloud Run service that converts font formats

For the main Node.js app, we'll use Heroku, which has a stable pricing structure, is very convenient to use, and is well-integrated with Git

Create a new project in [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) - set project id as you wish

Install Google Cloud SDK - if it was installed at sometime in the past, you may want to update

`gcloud components update`

From commandline, run

```
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project <project-id>
```

(Replace `<project-id>`)

If at any time you forget your project id, you can check with

`gcloud config get-value project`

Also set your default region

`gcloud config set run/region <region>`

WARNING: Selecting certain regions may invalidate free-of-charge service, and then you may get a high bill - I use `us-central1`, since it's been safe for me

## Credentials

To obtain `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` for working locally, go to

[console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey)

Create new JSON service account key with role of project owner

Your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` file will appear in your downloads - move it to a more secure location, such as `~/.ssh`

To view these credentials in the future, go to

[console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)

## Set up Storage

Create a new bucket - to do this from commandline

```
gsutil mb gs://<bucket-name>
```

If your bucket name has already been used, you must try a new name

Enable bucket permissions with CORS, which allows transactions with other web addresses

```
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://<bucket-name>
```

In the console permissions for your bucket, add `allUsers` with role `Storage Object Owner`

Create a Lifecycle Rule `Delete object` when `Age` is 1 day

`gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://<bucket-name>`

The console should show that Public Access is `Subject to ACLs`

Access Control should be `Fine-grained: Object-level ACLs enabled`

[console.cloud.google.com/storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage)

NOTE: Fine-grained control isn't really required, but, as I'm not particularly knowledgeable about the higher-level IAM permissions, and don't particularly care, I just use the ACL permissions

## Set up Github

If you haven't already, set up an SSH key in Github settings for easier deployment without authentication

[github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)

In Github, clone this project

## Set up Cloud Run

Now we will create the background service that converts SVG font files into OTF files

Go to Cloud Run and create a service

[console.cloud.google.com/run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run)

Choose a service name

Authentication `Allow unauthenticated invocations`

Configure the service's first revision `Deploy one revision...`

Container image URL `gcr.io/<project-id>/<service-name>`

You should see a message 'image not found' - that's okay, no image has yet been deployed

Enable Continuous Deployment - you'll be asked to log into Github

Select any other options required to enable Continuous Deployment

Set your Dockerfile path as `fontforge-container/Dockerfile`

Logs are viewable in the console

## Set Variables

Add these lines with correct information to `~/.bashrc`

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path-to-credential-file>"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="<project-id>"
```

Set the following entries in `config.js`

```
CLOUD_BUCKET: '<bucket-name>',
SVG_TO_OTF_SERVICE_URL: '<url-provided-in-cloud-run>',
```

Set the following in `fontforge-container/app.py`

```
bucket_name = '<bucket-name>'
```

## Run Locally

If everything is set up, then just run from the main project directory

`npm start`

Then in your browser, go to

`localhost:8080`

## Deploying to Heroku

Create an app in Heroku

In Heroku Deploy settings, connect the app to your Github repo, and enable automatic deploys

Even though we've enabled ACL and CORS, we still must also set up credentials that will permit Heroku services to talk to Google Cloud Storage through the API - whew! using Storage is a lot of work

Under your Heroku project's `Settings`, create two `Config Vars`

Name the first `GCP_CRED`

Copy and paste the data from your Google Cloud credential JSON file

Name another variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, and assign it the value `./gcp-config.json`

Deploy the app using Git from the commandline

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m update
git remote add origin https://github.com/<github-name>/<repo-name>.git
git push -u origin master
```

To view logs
```
heroku logs --tail -a <app-name>
```

Your app should be visible at `<heroku-app-name>.herokuapp.com`

## Check Billing

To ensure that you will not incur unexpected charges, periodically check the billing projection for the month

[console.cloud.google.com/billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)

[dashboard.heroku.com/account/billing](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account/billing)
